    Description
Magi Library (libmagi) implements Gateway Interfaces, namely CGI and FastCGI.

    Overview
Magi are free and open-source software: legal info is in the 'LICENSE' file.
They are written in ANSI C, without any dependecies, except for C standard
library.  All source and inner header files are located in the 'src' directory.
The 'include' directory is intended to be used in your include environment.
Headers in it contain library interface and its description in comments.
They are in subdirectory 'include/magi', due to their short and simple names.
If you are not about choosing which header to include and just want everything
to be included you can '#include <magi.h>'.
For detailed documentation look into 'man' directory.

    Compiling
Compilation and its options are described in the Makefile.
Running make produces libmagi.a file, which is precompiled library itself,
ready to be statically linked into your project.

    Examples
Running 'make examples' produces executable for each example in 'examples'.
Descriptions and details are in corresponding source files.

    Usage
magi_request handles incoming request, general workflow for CGI is to:
1. prepare request for analysis, setup defaults via magi_request_init;
2. analyse CGI request via magi_cgi;
4. do your work, and response request:
   1. specify headers (e.g. magi_response_cookie),
   2. fill response body (e.g. magi_response);
5. finally, free memory via magi_request_free.

    Motivation
Web must be fun.
