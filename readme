    Description
Magi Library (libmagi) implements Gateway Interfaces, namely CGI and FastCGI.

    Overview
Magi is free and open-source software: legal info is in the 'license' file.
It is written in ANSI C, without any dependecies, except for C standard
library.  All source and header files are located in the 'src' directory.
Files with 'inner' part in their names are not intended for external use.
Since filenames in the project are short and simple consider placing
header files in subdirectory 'magi' of your include.

    Compiling
Compilation and its options are described in the 'Makefile'.
Running 'make' produces 'libmagi.a' file, which is precompiled library itself,
ready to be statically linked into your project.

    Examples
Compilation and its options are described in the local 'examples/Makefile'.
Running 'make' in the 'examples' directory produces 'append', 'cookie',
'upload', and 'echo' CGI executables.  Descriptions and details are in
corresponding source files.

    Usage
Magi main purpose is to analyse request and provide it in 'struct magi_request'
variable.  It is described in 'src/request.h'; to setup defaults before actual
processing run 'magi_request_setup'.  Next step is to analyse post-unrelated
part of request via 'magi_request_cgi'.  Since post part can be realy big,
it is generally useful to constrain its analysis biased on the rest of request.
Post part analyse is done via 'magi_request_resume_cgi'.  You can destroy
request structure via 'magi_request_destroy'.

Also magi provide output capabilities via 'struct magi_response'.
Similary to request, 'magi_response_setup' is initialisation of response with
defaults.  Content type need to be specified for response, to set it run
'magi_response_content_type'.  You can set cookie with 'magi_response_cookie',
as well as discard them with 'magi_response_cookie_discard'.  You can set HTTP
headers with 'magi_response_http'.  For filling response body use 
'magi_response_add' and 'magi_response_add_format'.  To send response call
'magi_response_cgi'.  Desctruction is provided in 'magi_response_destroy'.

    Motivation
Web must be fun.
